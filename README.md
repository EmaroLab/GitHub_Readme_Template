# Title of the project

## Objective of the Project
It describes what the project wants to achieve and defines terminologies. Presents the hardware or tools used in the project.

## The Systemâ€™s Architecture

### Overall Architecture
It presents the overall architecture of the system with the help of a UML and it describes in simple words the overall architecture, which is designed to meet the objective of the project.

### Description of the Modules
This section presents in a detailed manner (in its sub-sections) each module within the architecture.
It describes all the modules within the architecture, i.e, (i) the prerequisites (e.g., all the hardware and software required for this module), (ii) the inputs to the module, (iii) the internal working, and (iv) the outputs of the module.

## Implementation

This section presents (in its sub-sections) how to run and test the modules.

## Results
This section presents (in its sub-sections) the result of each module. **Note that**: if all the modules have successfully completed their work and integrated everything together, then this section can present the overall result of the project, i.e., (i) the rqt_graph generated when the system is running, (ii) images or links to the videos of the working of the system (in real or in simulation). This can be done instead of having a sub-section dedicated to the 'results' of each module.

## Recommendations
The Recommendations follow naturally from the results. **Note that**: if all the modules have successfully completed their work and integrated everything together, then this section can present the overall recommendations for this project, i.e.,  (i) the assumptions made while building the system (and/or) the limitations of the working system, (ii) presenting possible ideas that could overcome the limitations or assumptions. This can be done instead of having a sub-section dedicated to the 'recommendations' for each module.

# Useful GitHub readme syntax

## To make bullet points

* Do this
	* Do this

## To make hyper-link

For example, making a link to [ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## To show, how to execute some commands in the terminal

    ```
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv3 #(should be already installed with previous point)
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv-apps
    ```

## To exphasize about a particular command

For example: Please do a ```catkin_make```, once you have modified your code. 

## To add image(s) or video(s)

* To embbed an image
