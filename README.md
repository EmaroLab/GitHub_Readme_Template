# Title of the project

## Objective of the Project
It describes what the project wants to achieve and defines terminologies. Presents the hardware or tools used in the project.

## Architecture of the System
It presents the overall architecture of the system with the help of a UML and it describes in simple words the overall architecture, which is designed to meet the objective of the project.

## Description of the Systemâ€™s Architecture
This section presents in a detailed manner (in its sub-sections) each module within the architecture.
It describes details about the the modules within the architecture, i.e, **(i)** names of the key people who developed the module, **(ii)** mention the files (packages/nodes) found in the repository that are associated to the module, **(iii)** the prerequisites (e.g., all the hardware and software required) for the module, **(iv)** the inputs to the module, **(v)** the internal working of the module, and **(vi)** the outputs of the module.

## Installation and Testing
This section presents (in its sub-sections) how to install/run and test the modules. **Note that:** If all the modules have successfully completed their work and integrated everything together, then this section can present the overall **Installation and Testing** procedure for the the "whole" system, instead of having a sub-section dedicated for each module

	* Do this

## To make hyper-link

For example, making a link to [ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## To show, how to execute some commands in the terminal

    ```
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv3 #(should be already installed with previous point)
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv-apps
    ```

## To exphasize about a particular command

For example: Please do a ```catkin_make```, once you have modified your code. 

## To add image(s) or video(s)
